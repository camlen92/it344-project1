IT 344 Operating Systems: Embedded or Mobile OS

Project #1 – Embedded/Mobile Operating Systems
Description
The growth of embedded and mobile devices is outpacing the desktop and service systems in today’s market. Many embedded and mobile operating systems are being developed and gaining popularity. You need to have a sense of what it is like to develop an application on those OS platforms.

Task
Here’s what you have to do for this project,

1.      Pick an embedded or mobile OS and its development platform.

2.      Install the SDK and make sure it includes a simulator for the target devices.

3.      Develop a simple application of your choice. Be creative.

4.      Your application must access either a sensor on the platform or an external API for full points. The choice is up to you.

It is recommended that you choose from one the following (well established and available) platforms,

·         Google Android (a special flavor of embedded Linux, uses Eclipse as the dev tool, available in Linux, Mac, and Windows)

·         iPhone OS (only works on Mac)

·         Other? (check with instructor/TA first)

These SDKs have sample code. It is perfectly OK to read and use sample code as starter and add your ideas onto it. You are free to choose other platforms, just make sure you have sufficient tools and documentation.
